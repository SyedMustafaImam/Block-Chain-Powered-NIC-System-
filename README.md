# Block-Chain-Powered-NIC-System-

## Discription
National database is very important concern for the Government. As it handles the information of its citizens. Therefore, data security is an essential aspect of this system. We need to have a system which is impenetrable to adversary attacks. Blockchain technology is a perfect solution to this problem.     In this project, we are going to implement blockchain from scratch. By using our own defined blocks and methods. For this we require to do self-study about blockchain, encryption/decryption, hashing algorithms, RSA and etc.

## To Run this Code
You need *[Net beans Ide](https://netbeans.org/downloads/6.1/index.html)* to run code by going to main.java in src folder.

## Milestones for this project

1. To implement the basics of the block chain
2. Making and Validation of Ledger
3. Making Blocks dynamic
3. Implementing to a real world project.
